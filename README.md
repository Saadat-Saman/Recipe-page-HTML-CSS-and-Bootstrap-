## My process
   First I created index.html file and coded all the content. I gave bootstrap classes to all my divs so that my website can be responsive. I also used CSS properties particularly wherever I had to overrride bootstrap styling.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about various bootstrap classes and their functionalities such as "my-4, mx-auto, lh-lg"

I also learned how to make numbering of an ordered list colored and bold.


```css
.ol li::marker{
      color:  hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
      font-weight: 900;
      font-size: 18px;
     }
```


### Continued development
I would like to focus on media queries, flexbox and grid in future projects.
